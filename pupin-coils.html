        Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils", 
        followed closely on the pioneering work of the English physicist and mathematician 
        Oliver Heaviside, which predates Pupin's patent by some seven years. The importance 
        of the patent was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired by American Telephone 
        & Telegraph (AT&T), making him wealthy. Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, 
        as they already had their own development in hand led by George Campbell and had up to this point been challenging 
        Pupin with Campbell's own patent. AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an invention which was immensely valuable 
        due to its ability to greatly extend the range of long distance telephones and especially submarine ones.

        When the United States joined the First World War in 1917, Pupin was working at Columbia University, organizing 
        a research group for submarine detection techniques.[13] Together with his colleagues, professors Wils and Morcroft,
        he performed numerous researches with the aim of discovering submarines at Key West and New London. He also conducted
        research in the field of establishing telecommunications between places. During the war Pupin was a member of the state 
        council for research and state advisory board for aeronautics. For his work he received a laudative from president Warren G. 
        Harding, which was published on page 386 of his autobiography.
