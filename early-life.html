    <h2>Early life</h2>
    <p>
      Mihajlo Pupin was born on 4 October (22 September, OS) 
      1858 in the village of Idvor (in the modern-day municipality of 
      Kovačica, Serbia) in Banat, in the Military Frontier in the Austrian
      Empire. He always remembered the words of his mother and cited her 
      in his autobiography, From Immigrant to Inventor (1925)
    </p>
    <em>
      "My boy, If you wish to go out into the world about which you hear so much
      at the neighborhood gatherings, you must provide yourself with another 
      pair of eyes; the eyes of reading and writing. There is so much wonderful 
      knowledge and learning in the world which you cannot get unless you can read
      and write. Knowledge is the golden ladder over which we climb to heaven; knowledge
      is the light which illuminates our path through this life and leads to a future life of everlasting glory."
    </em>
    <p>
      Pupin went to elementary school in his birthplace, to Serbian Orthodox school, and later
      to German elementary school in Perlez. He enrolled in high school in Pančevo, and later in t
      he Real Gymnasium. He was one of the best students there; a local archpriest saw his enormous
      potential and talent, and influenced the authorities to give Pupin a scholarship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of his activity in the "Serbian Youth" movement, which at that time had many problems with 
      Austro-Hungarian police authorities, Pupin had to leave Pančevo. In 1872, he went to Prague, where he 
      continued the sixth and first half of the seventh year. After his father died in March 1874, the sixteen-year-old 
      Pupin decided to cancel his education in Prague due to financial problems and to move to the United States.
    </p>
    <em>
      "When I landed at Castle Garden, forty-eight years ago, I had only five cents in my pocket. Had I brought five 
      hundred dollars, instead of five cents, my immediate career in the new, and to me perfectly strange, land would 
      have been the same. A young immigrant such as I was then does not begin his career until he has spent all the money 
      which he has brought with him. I brought five cents, and immediately spent it upon a piece of prune pie, which turned 
      out to be a bogus prune pie. It contained nothing but pits of prunes. If I had brought five hundred dollars, it would 
      have taken me a little longer to spend it, mostly upon bogus things, but the struggle which awaited me would have been 
      the same in each case. It is no handicap to a boy immigrant to land here penniless; it is not a handicap to any boy to be 
      penniless when he strikes out for an independent career, provided that he has the stamina to stand the hardships that may be 
      in store for him."

    <!-- studies -->
    <h2>Studies in America and Ph.D</h2>
    <p>
      For the next five years in the United States, Pupin worked as a manual laborer (most notably at the biscuit factory 
      on Cortlandt Street in Manhattan) while he learned English, Greek and Latin. He also gave private lectures. After 
      three years of various courses, in the autumn of 1879 he successfully finished his tests and entered Columbia College, 
      where he became known as an exceptional athlete and scholar. A friend of Pupin's predicted that his physique would make 
      him a splendid oarsman, and that Columbia would do anything for a good oarsman. A popular student, he was elected president 
      of his class in his Junior year. He graduated with honors in 1883 and became an American citizen at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Pupin completed his studies, with emphasis in the fields of physics and mathematics, he returned to Europe, initially 
      the United Kingdom (1883–1885), where he continued his schooling at the University of Cambridge. He obtained his Ph.D. at the 
      University of Berlin under Hermann von Helmholtz and in 1889 he returned to Columbia University to become a lecturer of mathematical
      physics in the newly formed Department of Electrical Engineering. Pupin's research pioneered carrier wave detection and current analysis
    </p>
    <p>
      He was an early investigator into X-ray imaging, but his claim to have made the first X-ray image in the United States is incorrect.
      He learned of Röntgen's discovery of unknown rays passing through wood, paper, insulators, and thin metals leaving traces on a photographic 
      plate, and attempted this himself. Using a vacuum tube, which he had previously used to study the passage of electricity through rarefied 
      gases, he made successful images on 2 January 1896. Edison provided Pupin with a calcium tungstate fluoroscopic screen which, when placed 
      in front of the film, shortened the exposure time by twenty times, from one hour to a few minutes. Based on the results of experiments, 
      Pupin concluded that the impact of primary X-rays generated secondary X-rays. With his work in the field of X-rays, Pupin gave a lecture at
      the New York Academy of Sciences. He was the first person to use a fluorescent screen to enhance X-rays for medical purposes.
